 * A vehicle.

 * This is basically a BaseObject with additional attributes, such as type and lights. Note that, if this vehicle is a
 * simulated ego vehicle (i.e. ego_vehicle is set to true), relative_ego_origin has to be set, defining the offset from
 * the ego vehicle's bounding box center to the center of the vehicle's rear axis. This defines the origin of the ego
 * vehicle's rear axis coordinate system and allows calculation of quantities relative to this reference frame. The
 * origin of the rear axis coordinate system in world coordinates is calculated as (base.position + relative_ego_origin)
 * for the ego vehicle. For all vehicles, including ego vehicles, the position given in base.position points to the
 * center of the vehicle's bounding box.
