    // Lux [lx] is the SI unit of luminance or illumination of a one metre square area, which is

    // quantity of visible light emitted by a source. The lumen is defined in relation to the candela [cd] as 1 [lm] =1 [cd sr] where [sr] denotes steradian, the unit of solid angle used in 3D geometry analogous to the radian.
