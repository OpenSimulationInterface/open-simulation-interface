    // Ambient light is any light in the vehicle's environment not emitted by the vehicle 
    // itself. It can include sun/moon light, light from other cars, street lights, etc.
    // 
    // Lux is the SI unit of luminance or illumination of a one metre square area, which is 
    // equal to one lumen per square meter 1lx = 1lm/m² [5].
    // The lumen (symbol: lm) is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total
    // quantity of visible light emitted by a source. The lumen is defined in relation to the candela (cd) as 1lm=1cd.sr where sr denotes steradian, the  unit of solid angle used in 3D geometry analogous to the radian. 
    //
    //Categorization is done based on natural day/night time illuminance levels [6] and standards for required lighting levels on roads [6, 7, 8, 9].
