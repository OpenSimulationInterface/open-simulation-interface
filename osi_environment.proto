    // emitted by the vehicle itself. It can include sun/moon light, light from
    // other cars, street lights etc.
    //
    // \note lx ("lux") is the SI unit of luminance or illumination of an area of exact
    // one square meter, which is equal to one lumen per square meter 1 lx =
    // 1 lm/m^2 [1].
    // lm ("lumen") is the SI derived unit of luminous flux and a measure of
    // the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source. The lumen is
    // defined in relation to cd ("candela") as 1 lm = 1 cd sr, where sr
    // denotes steradian, the unit of solid angle used in 3D geometry analogous
    // to the radian [1].
    //
    // Categorization is done based on natural day/night time illuminance levels
    // [2] and standards for required lighting levels on roads [2, 3, 4, 5].
