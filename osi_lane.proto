// \brief A lane in the road network.
//
// A lane is part of a road and mainly characterized by its center line. It also knows about any adjacent lanes,
// antecessor and successor lanes. 
// The following image will be referred to by later comments. We'll use the lane with ID 3 as reference if not mentioned otherwise.
//
// \image html highway_exit.png
//
// For lane a to be the antecessor of lane b, the last point of a's center line has to be identical to the first point
// of b's center line (although both points might lie outside the simulated region, the relationship remains). Any lane
// starts or ends at such a split/merge point. No lane can ever keep its ID after such a split point, i.e. lane 4 has to
// change its ID after lane 6 splits off of lane 4, thus in the example it becomes a new lane with ID 7.
