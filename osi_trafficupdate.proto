// \brief The traffic update message is provided by traffic
// participant models to provide updates to their position, state
// and future trajectory back to the simulation environment.
//
// \note For reasons of convenience and consistency, the
// updated information is provided as a MovingObject.  Certain fields
// of this sub-message are not required to be set and will be ignored by the
// simulation environment, because they are static information.
// Instead of creating a seperate message type for only the non-static
// information, re-use existing message.
//

    // The interface version used by the sender (traffic participant model).

    // The data timestamp of the simulation environment. Zero time is arbitrary
    // but must be identical for all messages. Zero time does not need to
    // coincide with the UNIX epoch. Recommended is the starting time point of
    // the simulation.
    //
    // \note For moving object update data the timestamp coincides both with
    // the notional simulation time the data applies to and the time it was sent.
    // There is no inherent latency for moving object update data, as opposed
    // to sensor data.
    //

    // \note It is not expected that static fields are populated. If they
    // are, they may be ignored by the receiver of this message, for example, dimensions,
    // or vehicle category.  All dynamic fields should be populated where known,
    // for example, velocity, light states, or future trajectory.
