// \brief The virtual sensor information derived from GroundTruth and potentially processed by sensor-models.
//
// The virtual sensor information is supposed to imitate the output of a real sensor. All information regarding the
// environment is given with respect to the sensor coordinate system specified in \c SensorData::mounting_position. 
// When simulating multiple sensors, each sensor has an individual copy of the SensorData interface. This allows an
// independent treatment of the sensors.
//

    // The ID of the sensor.
    //
    // This id can be equal to \c DetectionHeader::sensor_id. 
    // In case of a multisensor configuration this id is different to
    // the DetectionHeader::sensor_id.
    //
    // \note This is a redundant information because the sensor's 
    // mounting_position defines unique the host vehicle's sensor.

    // The timestamp of the sensor data. Zero time is arbitrary but must be
    // identical for all messages. Zero time does not need to coincide with
    // the unix epoch. Recommended is the starting time point of the
    // simulation.
    //
    // \note This is the point in time that the sensor data message becomes
    // available to the rest of the system (i.e. the driving functions), so
    // it corresponds with the sending time and thus takes the latency of
    // internal processing of the sensor into account. Latencies of bus
    // communications, etc., that occur after the sensor output have to be
    // applied on top of this, if needed.
    //
    // The time that the actual measurement was performed (which will usually
    // correspond with the timestamp of the GroundTruth the sensor model
    // processed to arrive at these results) can be found in the additional
    // field SensorData::last_measurement_time.
