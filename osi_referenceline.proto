// \brief A reference line for defining a non-Euclidean ST coordinate system
//
// A reference line is a 3D polyline, used for generating a non-Euclidean
// ST coordinate system.
//
// \note This ST coordinate system is specific to OSI and not to be confused with
//       similar definitions in other standards like OpenDRIVE or OpenSCENARIO 1.x.
//       Nevertheless the goal of this definition is to approximate the source
//       coordinates (e.g. OpenDRIVE).
//
// Notes on design decisions:
// - This is a polyline, and not some more complex curve. The advantage of a
//   polyline is that it is very simple to generate from various map formats,
//   and it is also easy to handle. The downside is that a polyline has no
//   direct curvature, and even the angle is not continuous (only C0 smooth).
//   In the author's experience, the benefits of a polyline outweigh the costs.

    // Points comprising the polyline.

    // The polyline is defined as the lines between consecutive points.
    // Each point has an S coordinate. Other attributes might be set, depending
    // on the type of the polyline (see Type).
    //
    // ## Rules on the S position
    //
    // There are a few requirements on the S position:
    // - Later points in the list must have strictly larger S coordinates than
    //   earlier points.
    // - For consecutive points, the S difference between them  must be at
    //   least as large as the 2D Euclidean distance between the points (2D
    //   distance == Euclidean distance between the points taking only X and Y
    //   into account).
    // - The S distance between two points may be larger than the 2D Euclidean
    //   distance, but should be not much larger. It is allowed to be larger if
    //   the underlying reference line (e.g. in an OpenDRIVE map) is a curve,
    //   and thus the sampled reference line has a smaller length than the original
    //   curve.
    //
    // Together, these rules allow directly putting OpenDRIVE S coordinates
    // into an OSI ReferenceLine.
    //
    // If the reference line approximates a curve (e.g. a clothoid in
    // OpenDRIVE), the points must be chosen in a way that the lateral distance
    // to the ideal line does not exceed 5cm. As shown in the following image:
    //
    // \image html line_approximation_error.svg "Approximation error"
    // Approximation error green line.
    //
    // Between two ReferenceLinePoints, both the world coordinate and the S
    // coordinate is interpolated linearly. So each S value uniquely describes
    // a point on the polyline.
    //
    // ## Extending the coordinate system infinitely
    //
    // For the purpose of this discussion, let's call the S position of the
    // first point \c sStart, and the S position of the last point \c sEnd.
    //
    // For some purposes, S positions outside the normally defined range (i.e.
    // outside [\c sStart,\c sEnd]) need to be defined. For this purpose, the
    // first line of the polyline is infinitely extended in negative S
    // direction.  Similarly, the last line of the polyline is infinitely
    // extended beyond the last point. The S value of points outside [\c
    // sStart,\c sEnd] is defined by the Euclidean 2D distance from the start
    // or end point, respectively.  So if <code>sStart = 15</code>, and a point
    // is on the line extended from the start position, with a 2D Euclidean
    // distance of 10 from the first point, then it has an S position of 5.
    //
    // A point is "before" the reference line, if its s coordinate is < \c sStart.
    // A point is "after" the reference line, if its s coordinate is > \c sEnd.
    //
    // ## Adding T coordinates
    //
    // To describe points that are not directly on the polyline, a T coordinate
    // is added. T is the signed 2D distance between the point to describe (P)
    // and a projected point (P_proj) on the polyline. There are two ways of
    // defining this point, depending on the ReferenceLine::Type (see below).
    //
    // The T coordinate of the point in question is then defined as
    // <code>hypot(P.X-P_proj.X,P.Y-P_proj.Y)</code>. The projected point P_proj
    // might either be on a line segment or at an edge between two line segments.
    // The distance is positive if the point is left of the polyline (in
    // definition direction), negative if it is right of it. The S position of
    // such a point outside the reference line is the same as the S value of the
    // projected point on the polyline.
    //
    // ## Nearest point (TYPE_POLYLINE)
    //
    // The projection point is the nearest point on the polyline (this point might
    // either be on a line segment or at an edge between two line segments).
    //
    // Notes:
    // - The "nearest point on the polyline" is determined in 3D (even if the
    //   resulting T value is only the 2D distance), in order to choose the
    //   correct point for 3D curves (think reference lines for roads in parking
    //   decks).
    // - If there are several "nearest points", the one with the smallest S
    //   coordinate on the polyline is chosen.
    //
    // Example:
    // \image html OSI_ReferenceLine1.svg "S, T calculation using nearest point"
    //
    // This shows a reference line (consisting of three points), and five points
    // not on the reference line.
    //
    // - For \c P1, the situation is clear, since there is exactly one nearest
    //   point on the polyline. The resulting ST coordinate uniquely maps back
    //   to \c P1.
    // - \c P2 has multiple points "nearest points" on the polyline.
    //   As can be seen here, two  ST coordinates map to \c P2 (red and grey
    //   dotted line).  Following the rules above, the one with the smallest S
    //   value is chosen (the red dotted line).
    // - \c P3 has a unique "nearest point" on the polyline. However, multiple
    //   points map to the same ST coordinate as that of \c P3, e.g. \c P4
    //   (drawn in grey).
    // - Finally, \c P5 shows how the reference line is extended infinitely for
    //   points that are "outside" the reference line.
    //
    // ## T axis definition (TYPE_POLYLINE_WITH_T_AXIS)
    //
    // The T axes of the two ReferenceLinePoints of each ReferenceLine segment
    // define a sector (or strip if parallel) of the plane. A point is associated
    // with the segment if it lies within this sector. For points being
    // associated with multiple segments, the actual segment to consider is
    // determined by the shortest 3D Euclidean distance between the point and the
    // segments in question.
    //
    // The T axis (projecting axis) is the line going through P and the
    // intersection point (I). I is defined as the intersection of both
    // T axes of two consecutive ReferenceLinePoints (see example and
    // image below for illustration).
    //
    // Special cases:
    // 1. If both T axes of the consecutive ReferenceLinePoint are parallel (so
    //    no intersection point exists), the resulting T axis orientation is equal
    //    to the T axis of these ReferenceLinePoints.
    // 2. For the extended lines outside the defined range the projection axis is
    //    parallel to the T axis of the respective end point.
    //
    // ## Rules on the T axis
    //
    // For the T axis at a specific ReferenceLinePoint the following rules apply:
    // - The T axis shall be close to the angle bisector (to the left in S
    //   direction) of the neighboring ReferenceLine segments.
    // - Small deviations from the angle bisector are allowed (e.g. to represent
    //   the T axis of OpenDRIVE, which is perpendicular to the OpenDRIVE
    //   reference line).
    // - The T axis must be located inside the sectors spanned by rotating the
    //   normal of one neighboring ReferenceLine segment into the normal of the
    //   other ReferenceLine segment on the shortest way.
    // - The T axis in the first and the last point of a ReferenceLine has to be
    //   perpendicular to the first and last segment of the ReferenceLine,
    //   respectively.
    //
    // Example:
    // \image html OSI_ReferenceLine2.svg "S, T calculation using T axis"
    //
    // This shows a reference line (consisting of three points \c R0, \c R1 and
    // \c R2) and two points (\c P1 and \c P2) not part of the reference line.
    //
    // Calculation of ST for \c P1:
    // - Calculate the intersection point \c I of the T axes of \c R0 and \c R1.
    // - As \c P1 lies in the sector defined by these T axes it is considered part
    //   of the reference line section between \c R0 and \c R1.
    // - The point \c P1 is projected onto the line segment [\c R0, \c R1] via the
    //   straight line through \c I (by calculating the intersection of the line
    //   segment and the projection axis), resulting in point \c P1_proj.
    //   If the T axes are parallel, projection is applied in the direction of
    //   these axes.
    // - The S coordinate of \c P1 is the S coordinate of \c P1_proj
    // - The T coordinate of \c P1 is the signed Euclidean distance to \c P1_proj.
    //
    // Calculation of \c P2 follows the same pattern.
    //
    // ## Defining angles
    //
    // Sometimes an angle to a reference line is needed. This shall be defined
    // as follows:
    // First the projected point on the polyline is determined, as described
    // below. If this point is on a line segment, then the angle is calculated
    // relative to the line segment on which the reference point lays.
    // If the projected point is at the edge between line segments, then the
    // angle of the following line shall be chosen.
    //
    // ## Converting between world coordinates and ST coordinates
    //
    // The above rules define an ST coordinate system across the whole XY plane.
    // Every XY position has an ST coordinate, but not necessarily a unique ST
    // coordinate.
    //
    // The sampling of the polyline must be chosen such that the error
    // when converting coordinates is "small enough". The exact needed
    // precision is defined for each user, where the reference line is
    // referenced.
    //
    // ## Creating reference lines
    //
    // When OSI is generated from OpenDRIVE, typically the reference lines will
    // be taken directly from the road reference lines in OpenDRIVE, and
    // sampled according to the accuracy requirements outlined above.
    //
    // Other map formats may not have reference lines, so they will have to be
    // synthesized by the tool generating OSI data. A few guidelines on this
    // process:
    //
    // - The reference line should follow the road
    // - It is preferable to have the reference line in the center of the road
    //   (e.g. on a highway, it should be in the middle between the two driving
    //   directions). Rationale: this makes S differences better approximate
    //   Euclidean distances, compared to having the reference line at one side
    //   of a curvy road.
    //
    // ## Various notes
    //
    // Notes on OpenDRIVE compatibility:
    // Ideally, one would want the polyline to be fully compatible with
    // OpenDRIVE, so that calculations done for OpenDRIVE directly match those
    // in OSI. There are a few difficulties with this:
    // - The T coordinate is nearly the same as for OpenDRIVE, but
    //   unfortunately not perfectly. In OpenDRIVE, if the road is tilted using
    //   superElevation, then the t coordinate system is tilted along, so the T
    //   coordinate is no longer calculated in the XY plane (as proposed for
    //   OSI). It doesn't seem feasable to implement the same tilting for OSI,
    //   so simulation tools will have to consider superElevation and convert
    //   the T coordinate accordingly: <code>t_OSI = t_OpenDRIVE *
    //   cos(alpha)</code>, where alpha is the superelevation angle.
    // - The angle will not be perfectly the same, due to the use of line
    //   segments in OSI, and curves in OpenDRIVE. In the authors opinion, the
    //   difference will be negligible if the #poly_line is suitably sampled.
    //
    // Notes on design decisions:
    // - The S coordinate is included directly, both for OpenDRIVE
    //   compatibility, and to speed up calculations.
    // - The rules on S coordinates (e.g. the calculation in 2D space) are
    //   there to ensure OpenDRIVE compatibility.
    // - The rules on T coordinates are there to ensure OpenDRIVE compatibility
    //   for lanes without superelevation, and to make it easier to convert
    //   between OSI and OpenDRIVE in case superelevation is present.
