//
// \brief The ground truth information from the simulation environment.
//
// This ground truth information is supposed to describe the whole simulated
// environment around any simulated vehicle.  For each simulated host vehicle
// (might only be one, but could also be multiple) define an area around the
// vehicle which is greater than the combined field of views (FOV) of all
// sensors obstructed in the vehicle. The ground truth data is supposed to
// describe the convex hull of all such areas w.r.t. a global simulation
// coordinate system.
//
// The simulation coordinate system might change during the simulation if and
// only if, all coordinates w.r.t. this coordinate system are also changed.
//
// The data has to be sent at a rate defined by the receiving partner. When
// sending, values with default values might be left default in order to improve
// performance.
//
// To provide a complete interface, all fields of all messages have to be set,
// unless specifically stated in the field's definition that the field may
// remain unset.
//
// In enums (e.g. types) the unknown (first / default) value is not allowed to
// be used in the ground truth interface.

    //
    // \note For ground truth data this timestamp coincides both with the
    // notional simulation time the data applies to and the time it was sent
    // (there is no inherent latency for ground truth data, as opposed to
    // sensor data).
