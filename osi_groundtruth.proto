// \brief The ground truth information from the simulation environment.
//
// This ground truth information is supposed to describe the whole simulated environment around any simulated vehicle.
// For each simulated ego vehicle (might only be one, but could also be multiple) define an area around the vehicle
// which is greater than the combined field of views (FOV) of all sensors obstructed in the vehicle. The ground truth
// data is supposed to describe the convex hull of all such areas w.r.t. a global simulation coordinate system.
//
// The simulation coordinate system might change during the simulation if and only if, all coordinates w.r.t. this
// coordinate system are also changed.
//
// The data has to be sent at a rate defined by the receiving partner. When sending, values with default values might be
// left default in order to improve performance.
//
// To provide a complete interface, all fields of all messages have to be set, unless specifically stated in the field's
// definition that the field may remain unset.
//
// In enums (e.g. types) the unknown (first / default) value is not allowed to be used in the ground truth interface.
