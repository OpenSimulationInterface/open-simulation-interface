== Purpose

At this time of the year Santa goes on his rounds and has also given thought to this planet’s sensor modelers.”.
We have taken note of the current status of the ISO 23150 discussions, including ultrasonic and camera detections.
The traffic signs have been reworked and the documentation has been extended for a perfect user experience.
Trust me - it's amazing!

* Introduced light states for emergency and service vehicles.
* Added orientation_acceleration and updated formulas.
* Extended documentation with svg images.
* Added model_reference for static and moving objects.
* Added map_reference in ground truth.
* Added proj4 string for coordinate transformations.
* Introduced raster_lidar_proposal from innoviz.
* Improved documentation with HTML tables and images for all traffic signs.

* **Bug Fix**: Changed open_simulation_interface target back from being a static library to its previous state as a shared library (this reverts an inadvertent change in v3.1.0 from previous releases).
v3.1.0 breaks all users of the shared library (that is, everyone building on Linux/Unix systems, and even some using the DLL on Windows).

* **Bugfix**: The version number is now correct in the VERSION file.
