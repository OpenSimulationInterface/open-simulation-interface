`v3.2.0 - OSI "Editorial Eaton" <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface/releases/tag/v3.2.0>`_
==============================

`Think p(OSI)tive! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M>`_

Purpose:
---------
The work on the OSI project was until now mainly organized by the BMW AG. In order to enable as many interested parties as possible to
contribute to the success of the Open Simulation Interface the project has been transferred to the `ASAM e.V. <https://www.asam.net/>`_
which has been made public in the `ASAM press release <https://www.asam.net/news-media/news/detail/news/bmw-transfers-open-simulation-interface-osi-to-asam/>`_.
A new chapter in the development of OSI is now opened with the `kickoff workshop <https://www.asam.net/conferences-events/detail/asam-osi-kick-off-workshop/>`_
leading to hopefully many project proposals streamlining the efficient future development of the interface.
Due to this we decided to focus on the improvement of processes and documentation with this release.
