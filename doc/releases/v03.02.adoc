== Purpose

It was previously the case that the company BMW AG organized most of the work on the OSI project.
To make it possible for as many interested parties as possible to contribute to the success of the Open Simulation Interface, the project has been transferred to https://www.asam.net/[ASAM e.V.].
This has been made public in the https://www.asam.net/news-media/news/detail/news/bmw-transfers-open-simulation-interface-osi-to-asam/[ASAM press release].
A new chapter in the development of OSI has been opened with the https://www.asam.net/conferences-events/detail/asam-osi-kick-off-workshop/[kickoff workshop], which will hopefully generate lots of project proposals to streamline the efficient future development of the interface.
Whith this release, we therefore decided to focus on improving processes and documentation.
