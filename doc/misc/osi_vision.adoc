= The idea of Open Simulation Interface

The Open Simulation Interface (OSI) is a specification for interfaces between models and components of a distributed simulation.
OSI uses Google's Protocol Buffers.
OSI has a strong focus on environmental perception of automated driving functions.
However, OSI also specifies interfaces for modeling traffic participants.
