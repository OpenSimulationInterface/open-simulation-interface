**Prerequisites**

* You have _cmake_ installed.
* You have installed _protobuf_.
* You must have super user privileges.

**Steps**

. Open a terminal.
. Clone the Open Simulation repository.

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface.git
----
+
. Change into the repository directory.
+
[source]
----
cd open-simulation-interface
----
+
. Create a new directory for the build.
+
[source]
----
mkdir build
----

. Run cmake.
  To build a 32-bit target under 64-bit Linux, add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-m32"` to the cmake command.
  In this case, protobuf must be in 32-bit mode too.
