**Prerequisites**

* You have installed _cmake_.
* You have installed _protobuf_.
* You must have super user privileges.

**Steps**

. Open a terminal.
. Clone the Open Simulation repository.

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface.git
----
+
. Switch to the repository directory.
+
[source]
----
cd open-simulation-interface
----
