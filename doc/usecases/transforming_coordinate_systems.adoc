= Coordinate transformations

== Vehicle and sensor coordinate systems

When running simulations, it is frequently necessary to transform coordinates from the world coordinate system for a specific vehicle and its sensors.

This section provides an overview of the messages and fields involved and their relationship for this task.
It demonstrates how a world coordinate system, vehicle coordinate system, and sensor coordinate system are related on the basis of a specific (ego) vehicle.

//TODO: Should we add one or more sentences about the mathematical operations involved?

**Corresponding messages**

``GroundTruth::moving_object::base::position``::
This field defines the position of the vehicle's reference point in world coordinates.
In Open Simulation Interface, an object's position is defined by the coordinates of the center of the object's 3D bounding box.

``GroundTruth::moving_object::base::orientation``::
This field defines the orientation of the vehicle's reference point in world coordinates.

``GroundTruth::moving_object::vehicle_attributes::bbcenter_to_rear``::
This field specifies the vector pointing from the vehicle's reference point to the middle of the rear axle under neutral load conditions in the vehicle coordinates.

``SensorData::mounting_position``::
This field defines the sensor's position and orientation and thereby the origin of the sensor coordinate system.
The mounting position is given in the vehicle coordinate system.

**Example**

The following image shows the relationship between the coordinate systems.
The reference point of the vehicle is given by a vector in the world coordinate system.
A vector pointing from the reference position of the vehicle to the center of the rear axle then yields the origin of the vehicle coordinate system.
The mounting positions of the sensors and therefore the origins of the corresponding sensor coordinate systems are given with respect to the vehicle coordinate system.
