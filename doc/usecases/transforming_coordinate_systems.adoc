= Transforming coordinate systems

Transforming coordinates for a specific vehicle or sensor is a common task when running simulations.
OSI uses DIN ISO 8855:2013-11 for coordinate systems and transformations between coordinate systems.

//TODO: Should we add one or more sentences about the mathematical operations involved?

**Corresponding messages**

``GroundTruth::moving_object::base::position``::
Defines the position of the vehicle’s reference point in world coordinates.
In Open Simulation Interface, the position of an object is defined by the coordinates of the center of the object's bounding box.

``GroundTruth::moving_object::base::orientation``::
Defines the orientation of the vehicle’s reference point in world coordinates.

``GroundTruth::moving_object::vehicle_attributes::bbcenter_to_rear``::
The vector pointing from the vehicle’s reference point to the middle of the rear axle under neutral load conditions in vehicle coordinates.

``SensorData::mounting_position``::
Defines the sensor’s position and orientation and thereby the origin of the sensor coordinate system.
The mounting position is given in the vehicle coordinate system.

**Example**

The following image shows the relationship between the coordinate systems.
The reference point of the vehicle is given by a vector in the world coordinate system.
A vector pointing from the reference position of the vehicle to the center of the rear axle then yields the origin of the vehicle coordinate system.
The mounting positions of the sensors and therefore the origins of the corresponding sensor coordinate systems are then given with respect to the vehicle coordinate system.
