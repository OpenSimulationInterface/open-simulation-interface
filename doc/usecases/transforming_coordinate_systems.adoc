== Vehicle and sensor coordinate systems

When running simulations, it is frequently necessary to transform coordinates from the global coordinate system for a specific vehicle and its sensors.

This section provides an overview of the messages and fields involved and their relationship for this task.
It demonstrates how a global coordinate system, vehicle coordinate system, and sensor coordinate system are related on the basis of a specific (ego) vehicle.

**Mathematical Definitions of Coordinate Transformations**

All vectors and matrices are noted with reference frame as a superscript index and the direction of translation as a supscript index. cite:[reuper2020]
The translation direction is from the first index to the second index (src: source coordinate system, trg: target coordinate system).
The vector latexmath:[\boldsymbol{v}^x] denotes the 3D position of an object in the coordinate frame latexmath:[x].
Vector latexmath:[\boldsymbol{t}] is the translation vector between two coordinate systems with the described indices for reference frame and direction.
The angles yaw latexmath:[\psi] around the z-axis, pitch latexmath:[\theta] around the y-axis and roll latexmath:[\phi] around the x-axis are defined in a right handed coordinate system according to DIN ISO 8855:2013 cite:[iso8855].
The sign of the angles corresponds to the direction of the transformation.

Transformation from source latexmath:[src] to target latexmath:[trg] coordinates:
[latexmath]
++++
\boldsymbol{v}^{trg} = \boldsymbol{R}_{src}^{trg} (\boldsymbol{v}^{src} - \boldsymbol{t}_{src,trg}^{src})
++++

Transformation back from target latexmath:[trg] to source latexmath:[src] coordinates
[latexmath]
++++
\boldsymbol{v}^{src} = (\boldsymbol{R}_{src}^{trg})^{-1} \boldsymbol{v}^{trg}  + \boldsymbol{t}_{src,trg}^{src}
++++


With the rotation matrix (from rotating the coordinate system) cite:[wiki_rotation_matrix]:
[latexmath]

\boldsymbol{R}_{srv}^{trg}=\boldsymbol{R}_{yaw,pitch,roll} = \boldsymbol{R}_{z,y,x} = \boldsymbol{R}_{x}(\phi) \boldsymbol{R}_{y}(\theta) \boldsymbol{R}_{z}(\psi) \\

\boldsymbol{R}_{z,y,x} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \cos(\phi) & \sin(\phi)\\
0 & -\sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi)
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & 0 & -\sin(\theta)\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
\sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\psi) & \sin(\psi) & 0\\
-\sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0\\
0 & 0 &1
\end{pmatrix} \\

\boldsymbol{R}_{z,y,x} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta)\cos(\psi) & \cos(\theta)\sin(\psi) & -\sin(\theta)\\
\sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\cos(\psi)-\cos(\phi)\sin(\psi) & \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\sin(\psi)+\cos(\phi)\cos(\psi) & \sin(\phi)\cos(\theta)\\
\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)\cos(\psi)+\sin(\phi)\sin(\psi) & \cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)\sin(\psi)-\sin(\phi)\cos(\psi) & \cos(\phi)\cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}

Get Taitâ€“Bryan angles from rotation matrix cite:[wiki_euler_angles]:
[latexmath]

\theta = -\arcsin(R_{13}) \\
\psi = \arctan2(R_{12}/\cos(\theta),R_{11}/\cos(\theta)) \\
\phi = \arctan2(R_{23}/\cos(\theta),R_{33}/\cos(\theta))

To transform from world coordinates into vehicle coordinates and back use the formulas from above with the world coordinates frame latexmath:[w] as source system latexmath:[src] and vehicle coordinates frame latexmath:[v] as target system latexmath:[trg].
To transform from world coordinates into vehicle coordinates and back use the formulas from above with the vehicle coordinates frame latexmath:[v] as source system latexmath:[src] and sensor coordinates frame latexmath:[s] as target system latexmath:[trg].


**Corresponding messages**

``GroundTruth::moving_object::base::position``::
This field defines the position of the vehicle's reference point in global coordinates.
In Open Simulation Interface, an object's position is defined by the coordinates of the center of the object's 3D bounding box.

``GroundTruth::moving_object::base::orientation``::
This field defines the orientation of the vehicle's reference point in global coordinates.

``GroundTruth::moving_object::vehicle_attributes::bbcenter_to_rear``::
This field specifies the vector pointing from the vehicle's reference point to the middle of the rear axle under neutral load conditions in the vehicle coordinates.

``SensorData::mounting_position``::
This field defines the sensor's position and orientation and thereby the origin of the sensor coordinate system.
The mounting position is given in the vehicle coordinate system.

**Example**

The following image shows the relationship between the coordinate systems.
The reference point of the vehicle is given by a vector in the global coordinate system.
A vector pointing from the reference position of the vehicle to the center of the rear axle then yields the origin of the vehicle coordinate system.
The mounting positions of the sensors and therefore the origins of the corresponding sensor coordinate systems are given with respect to the vehicle coordinate system.
