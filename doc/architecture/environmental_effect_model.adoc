= Environmental effect model

Environmental effect models consume sensor-view messages and produce sensor-view messages.
Environmental effect models may, for example, alter sensor-view messages to include effects and phenomena caused by:

* Shadows and occlusions
* Weather effects
* Physics of a sensor
* Pre-processing of raw sensor data
