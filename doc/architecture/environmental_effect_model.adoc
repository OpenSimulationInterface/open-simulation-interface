= Environmental effect model

Environmental effect models consume `SensorView` messages and produce `SensorView` messages.
Environmental effect models may, for example, alter `SensorView` messages to include effects and phenomena caused by:

* Shadows and occlusions
* Weather effects
* Physics of a sensor
* Pre-processing of raw sensor data
