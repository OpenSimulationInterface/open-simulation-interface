= OSI trace file naming conventions

**Name format**

The names of OSI trace files should have the following format:

----
<timestamp>_<type>_<osi-version>_<protobuf-version>_<number-of-frames>_<custom-trace-name>.osi
----

**Types**

`sv`::
Trace file contains `SensorView` messages.

`svc`::
Trace file contains `SensorViewConfiguration` messages.

`gt`::
Trace file contains `GroundTruth` messages.

`hvd`::
Trace file contains `HostVehicleData` messages.

`sd`::
Trace file contains `SensorData` messages.

`tc`::
Trace file contains `TrafficCommand` messages.

`tcu`::
Trace file contains `TrafficCommandUpdate` messages.

`tu`::
Trace file contains `TrafficUpdate` messages.

`mr`::
Trace file contains `MotionRequest` messages.

`su`::
Trace file contains `StreamingUpdate` messages.

`multi`::
Trace file contains multiple types of messages for use with multi channel trace file format.
In this case the number-of-frames field should be the largest number of frames across all channels.
The OSI version field should be based on the `version` field in the file meta-data of the multi-channel trace file.
The protobuf version field should be based on the `min_protobuf_version` field in the file meta-data of the multi-channel trace file.

**Example**

Given an OSI trace file with the following information:

[#tab-example-osi-trace-file-information]
.Example OSI trace file information
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Timestamp (ISO 8601) cite:[iso8601]
|20210818T150542Z

|Type
|SensorView

|OSI version
|3.1.2

|Protobuf version
|3.0.0

|Number of frames
|1523

|Custom trace name
|highway
|===

The recommended file name is:

----
20210818T150542Z_sv_312_300_1523_highway.osi
----

For a corresponding multi channel trace file containing `SensorView` and `GroundTruth` messages, the recommended file name is:

----
20210818T150542Z_multi_312_300_1523_highway.mcap
----
