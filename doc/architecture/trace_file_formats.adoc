= OSI trace file formats

There are two formats for storing multiple serialized OSI messages in one trace file.

*.osi::
Binary trace file.
Messages are separated by a length specification before each message.
The length is represented by a four-byte, little-endian, unsigned integer.
The length does not include the integer itself.

*.txth::
Human-readable plain-text trace file.
Messages are separated by newlines.

NOTE: Previous releases of OSI also supported a so-called plain-text trace file format, with file extension `.txt`.
This legacy format did not contain plain-text, but rather binary protobuf messages separated by a special separator.
For obvious reasons the format was deprecated and fully replaced with the `.osi` binary file format.
This release no longer contains any support for the legacy `.txt` file format.
These files may be used for manual checks.
