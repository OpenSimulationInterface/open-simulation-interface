= OSI trace file formats

There are multiple formats for storing multiple serialized OSI messages in one trace file.

*.osi::
Binary trace file.
Messages are separated by a length specification before each message.
The length is represented by a four-byte, little-endian, unsigned integer.
The length does not include the integer itself.

*.txt::
Plain-text trace file.
Messages are separated by `$$__$$`.

*.txth::
Human-readable plain-text trace file.
Messages are separated by newlines.
These files may be used for manual checks.
