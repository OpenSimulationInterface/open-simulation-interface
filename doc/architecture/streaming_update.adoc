= Streaming update

The `StreamingUpdate` message provides an interface to transmit a subset of ground truth and/or vehicle internal data.
This interface mainly addresses applications with low latency requirements and no need for highly consistent and complete data, e.g. visualization applications.
Static and/or non-relevant objects can be omitted as required for the specific use case.
Note that the receiver of partial updates can only rely on the most up-to-date information at the corresponding timestamp. E.g. omitting objects does not indicate static behavior but it may be sufficient for the use case to update certain objects at a later point in time.
