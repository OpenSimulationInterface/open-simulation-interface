= Overview of OSI architecture

OSI contains an object-based environment description using the message format of the https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/wiki[Protocol Buffer] library developed and maintained by Google.
OSI defines top-level messages that are used to exchange data between separate models.
Top-level messages define the ``GroundTruth`` interface, the ``SensorData`` interface and, since OSI version 3.0.0, the ``SensorView``, ``SensorViewConfiguration`` and ``FeatureData`` interfaces.

The following figure shows the interfaces and models involved in modeling a sensor.

OSI also defines interfaces for traffic participant models.
These interfaces allow to send commands to traffic participant models and to receive their updated state.
The following figure shows the interfaces of a generic traffic participant.

Traffic participant models may use other OSI interfaces internally, for example, to model autonomous vehicles.
The following figure shows a more advanced use case for traffic participants.

OSI currently provides only limited support for data structures describing measured internal states of the traffic participant.
Actuator intentions are currently not covered by OSI and must be handled with a different data description format.
