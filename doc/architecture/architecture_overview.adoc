= Overview of OSI architecture

OSI contains an object-based environment description that uses the message format of the https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/wiki[Protocol Buffer] library.
Google developed and maintains the Protocol Buffer library.
OSI defines top-level messages that are used to exchange data between separate models.
Top-level messages define the `GroundTruth` interface, the `SensorData` interface, and – since OSI version 3.0.0 – the interfaces `SensorView` and `SensorViewConfiguration`.
Further top-level messages that were added in later versions of OSI are `TrafficCommand`, `TrafficUpdate`, `MotionRequest`, and `StreamingUpdate`.

The following figure shows the interfaces and models involved in modeling a sensor.

OSI also defines interfaces for traffic participant models.
The `TrafficCommand` interface makes it possible to send commands to traffic participant models.
The `TrafficUpdate` interface makes it possible to receive the updated state from traffic participant models.
The following figure shows the interfaces of a generic traffic participant.

Traffic participant models may use other OSI interfaces internally, for example, to model autonomous vehicles.
The following figure shows a more advanced use case for traffic participants.

The `HostVehicleData` interface describes the measured internal states of a traffic participant.
OSI currently provides only limited support for data structures that describe measured internal states of traffic participants.
One example would be the `MotionRequest` interface that can be used to communicate the results of the behavior planning to the dynamic model.

The `StreamingUpdate` interface enables partial ground truth updates to modules that favor performance, especially latency, over data completeness/consistency (e.g. visualization applications) or that do not require complete data in the first place (e.g. logging applications).

NOTE: OSI uses singular instead of plural for `repeated` field names.

NOTE: All fields in an interface are set to `optional`.
`required` is not used.

This has been done to allow backward-compatible changes in the field.
Additionally, this is the default behavior in Protocol Buffer version 3 that no longer has the `required` type.
Setting all fields to `optional` thus ensures update compatibility.
However, this does not mean that it is optional to fill the field.
Fields with the rule `is_set` are mandatory and have to be set at all times.
All other fields have to be set according to the requirements of the connected models.

NOTE: All field numbers equal to or greater than 10000 are available for user-specific extensions via custom fields.
No future evolution of OSI will therefore use field numbers equal to or greater than 10000.
