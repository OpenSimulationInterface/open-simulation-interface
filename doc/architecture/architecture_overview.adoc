= Overview of OSI architecture

OSI contains an object-based environment description using the message format of the https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/wiki[Protocol Buffer] library developed and maintained by Google.
OSI defines top-level messages that are used to exchange data between separate models.
Top-level messages define the ``GroundTruth`` interface, the ``SensorData`` interface and, since OSI version 3.0.0, the ``SensorView``, ``SensorViewConfiguration`` and ``FeatureData`` interfaces.

The following figure shows the interfaces and models involved in modeling a sensor.

OSI also defines interfaces for traffic participant models.
The ``TrafficCommand`` interface allows to send commands to traffic participant models.
The ``TrafficUpdate`` interface allows to receive their updated state.
The following figure shows the interfaces of a generic traffic participant.

Traffic participant models may use other OSI interfaces internally, for example, to model autonomous vehicles.
The following figure shows a more advanced use case for traffic participants.

The ``HostVehicleData`` interface describes the measured internal states of a traffic participant
OSI currently provides only limited support for data structures describing measured internal states traffic participants.
Actuator intentions are currently not covered by OSI and must be handled with a different data description format.

All fields in an interface are set to `optional`.
`required` is not used.
This has been done to allow backward-compatible changes in the field.
Additionally, this is the default behavior in Protocol Buffer version 3 that does no longer have the `required` type and therefore ensures update compatibility.
However, this does not mean that filling the field is optional.
For the purpose of providing a complete interface, all existing fields should be set, unless not setting a field carries a specific meaning as indicated in the accompanying comment.

All field numbers equal to or greater than 10000 are available for user-specific extensions via custom fields.
Therefore, no future evolution of OSI will use field numbers equal to or greater than 10000.
