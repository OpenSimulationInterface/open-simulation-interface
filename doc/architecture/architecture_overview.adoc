= Overview of OSI architecture

OSI contains an object-based environment description that uses the message format of the https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/wiki[Protocol Buffer] library.
Google developed and maintains the Protocol Buffer library.
OSI defines top-level messages that are used to exchange data between separate models.
Top-level messages define the `GroundTruth` interface, the `SensorData` interface, and – since OSI version 3.0.0 – the interfaces `SensorView`, `SensorViewConfiguration`, and `FeatureData`.

The following figure shows the interfaces and models involved in modeling a sensor.

OSI also defines interfaces for traffic participant models.
The `TrafficCommand` interface makes it possible to send commands to traffic participant models.
The `TrafficUpdate` interface makes it possible to receive the updated state from traffic participant models.
The following figure shows the interfaces of a generic traffic participant.

Traffic participant models may use other OSI interfaces internally, for example, to model autonomous vehicles.
The following figure shows a more advanced use case for traffic participants.

The `HostVehicleData` interface describes the measured internal states of a traffic participant.
OSI currently provides only limited support for data structures that describe measured internal states of traffic participants.
Actuator intentions are currently not covered by OSI and must be handled using a different data description format.

NOTE: OSI uses singular instead of plural for `repeated` field names.

NOTE: All fields in an interface are set to `optional`.
`required` is not used.

This has been done to allow backward-compatible changes in the field.
Additionally, this is the default behavior in Protocol Buffer version 3 that no longer has the `required` type.
Setting all fields to `optional` thus ensures update compatibility.
However, this does not mean that it is optional to fill the field.
For the purpose of providing a complete interface, all existing fields should be set, unless not setting a field carries a specific meaning, as indicated in the accompanying comment.

NOTE: All field numbers equal to or greater than 10000 are available for user-specific extensions via custom fields.
No future evolution of OSI will therefore use field numbers equal to or greater than 10000.
