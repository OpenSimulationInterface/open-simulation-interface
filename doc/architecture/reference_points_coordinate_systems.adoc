= Coordinate systems and reference points

OSI uses DIN ISO 8855:2013-11 for coordinate systems and transformations between coordinate systems.
OSI uses three coordinate systems:

World coordinate system::
Coordinate system for all entities which are part of ground truth.
The world coordinate system is an inertial x/y/z-coordinate system.

Sensor coordinate system::
Coordinate system for all entities which are part of sensor data.
The origin is the mounting position of the physical sensor or a virtual mounting position, depending on the technology.

Object coordinate system::
Coordinate system for local object coordinates.
The origin of the corresponding coordinate systems is not necessarily identical to the center of the object's bounding box.
