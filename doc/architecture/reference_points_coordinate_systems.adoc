= Coordinate systems, reference points and coordinate transformation

OSI uses DIN ISO 8855:2013-11 cite:[iso8855] for coordinate systems and transformations between coordinate systems.
OSI uses the following coordinate systems:

Global coordinate system::
Coordinate system for all entities that are part of ground truth.
The global coordinate system is an inertial x/y/z-coordinate system.
The origin is the global reference point that is determined by the environment simulation.
This reference point may be derived from map data or other considerations.
Global coordinates can be mapped to a geographic coordinate system via `osi3::GroundTruth::proj_string`.
Note that before applying any PROJ transformations to global coordinates, the `osi3::GroundTruth::proj_frame_offset` must be applied.

Host vehicle coordinate system::
The host vehicle coordinate system's origin is defined to be at the center of the rear axle of the host vehicle.

Sensor coordinate system::
Coordinate system for all entities that are part of sensor data.
The origin is the mounting position of the physical sensor or a virtual mounting position, depending on the OSI message.
Both physical and virtual sensor coordinate systems are relative to the host vehicle coordinate system.

Object coordinate system::
Local object coordinate system.
The origin of the corresponding coordinate system is not necessarily identical to the center of the object's bounding box.
If the origin of the corresponding coordinate system is not identical to the center of the object's bounding box, the object documentation will provide the actual definition.
