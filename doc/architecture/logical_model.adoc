= Logical model

Logical models consume sensor-data messages and produce sensor-data messages.

An example of a logical model is a sensor-fusion model, which combines the output of multiple sensor models to produce data with less uncertainty.
Another use case is the fault-injection model which, contrary to a sensor-fusion model, may be used to increase uncertainties.
