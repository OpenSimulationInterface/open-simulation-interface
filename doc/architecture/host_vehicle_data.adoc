= Host vehicle data

The `HostVehicleData` message targets the perception of the vehicle of its own internal states.

It captures the knowledge the vehicle has internally, which can differ from the actual or global truth for various reasons.
This message can also be understood as an interface container for the signals of a rest bus simulation.
