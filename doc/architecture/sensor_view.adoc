= Sensor view

Sensor view imitates the input of sensors.
Sensor-view data is derived from ground-truth data.
All information regarding the environment is given with respect to the virtual sensor coordinate system, with two exceptions:

* Physical technology-specific data, given with respect to the physical sensor coordinate system specified in the corresponding physical sensorâ€™s mounting position.
* Ground-truth data, given in the global coordinate system.
