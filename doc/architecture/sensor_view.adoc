= Sensor view

Sensor view imitates the input of sensors.
Sensor-view messages are derived from ground-truth messages.
All information regarding the environment is given with respect to the virtual sensor coordinate system, with two exceptions:

* Physical technology-specific data, given with respect to the physical sensor coordinate system specified in the corresponding physical sensorâ€™s mounting position.
* Ground truth, given in the global coordinate system.
