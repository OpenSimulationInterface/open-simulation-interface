= Sensor view

The sensor view provides the input to OSI sensor models.
`SensorView` messages are derived from `GroundTruth` messages.
All information regarding the environment is given with respect to the virtual sensor coordinate system, with two exceptions:

* Physical technology-specific data, given with respect to the physical sensor coordinate system specified in the corresponding physical sensor's mounting position.
  One example of technology-specific data is: xref:gen:structosi3_1_1CameraSensorView.adoc#ac58456a34babf78792ea2608eb963f36[`image_data` of `osi3::CameraSensorView`]
* Ground truth given in the global coordinate system.
