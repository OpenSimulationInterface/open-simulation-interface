// \brief This message enables the traffic participant model to send updates 
// to the scenario engine about the execution of its received \c TrafficCommand input. 
// While traffic actions are usually executed successfully by the traffic participant,
// there may be actions which the traffic participant is not able to execute
// either for capability or situation-specific reasons. 
// 
// This message allows a traffic participant to send feedback if an action 
// cannot happen as requested by the \c TrafficCommand. Currently, it is out of
// scope to standardize the exact reason for non-executability or failed execution 
// because the reason can have multiple explanations. The responsibility for deciding 
// about successful or unsuccessful scenario execution lies fully on the side of the 
// scenario engine.  
//
// \note This interface is currently just a placeholder and could be
// changed in experimental ways to support semantics of upcoming OpenSCENARIO 
// versions.
