// \brief This message enables the traffic participant model to send updates 
// to the scenario engine about the execution of its received \c TrafficCommand input. 
// While traffic actions are usually executed successfully by the traffic participant 
// there may be actions which the traffic participant is not able to execute
// either for capability or situation-specific reasons. This message gives
// the traffic participant the basic possiblity to send feedback if an action 
// cannot happen as requested by the \c TrafficCommand. Currently, it is out of
// scope to standardize the exact reason for non-executability or failed execution 
// because the reason can have multiple explantions. The point in time 
// for this message to be sent is only restricted to be after (or at the same time) 
// the \c TrafficCommand with the corresponding traffic action(s) has been sent. The 
// responsibility for deciding about successful or unsuccessful scenario execution
// lies fully on the side of the scenario engine.  
//
// \note This interface is currently just a placeholder and could be
// changed in experimental ways to support semantics of upcoming OpenSCENARIO 
// versions.
